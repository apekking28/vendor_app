# Vendor Management API

## Project Description

The Vendor Management API is a robust Spring Boot application designed to streamline the process of vendor registration and data management. This project was developed as part of a technical test for the Backend Developer position at Sinergi Informatika Semen Indonesia.

### Key Features:

1. **Vendor Registration**: Provides a secure endpoint for new vendors to register in the system.

2. **Data Management (CRUD Operations)**: Offers a comprehensive set of API endpoints to Create, Read, Update, and Delete vendor information.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Implements a rate limiting mechanism to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse. The API is limited to a specified number of requests per second.

4. **Security Implementation**: Utilizes Spring Security to protect the API endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive operations.

### Technical Highlights:

- Built with Java 17 and Spring Boot, leveraging the latest features and best practices in Java development.
- Uses Spring Data JPA for efficient database operations.
- Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
- Features a custom rate limiting solution to manage API traffic effectively.
- Follows RESTful API design principles for intuitive and standardized endpoint usage.

This Vendor Management API demonstrates proficiency in creating secure, scalable, and efficient backend solutions using modern Java technologies. It showcases the implementation of essential features required in enterprise-level applications, such as security, rate limiting, and comprehensive data management capabilities.
